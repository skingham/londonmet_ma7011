\section{QISKIT Quantum Circuit Implementations}

The IBM Quantum Platform was made available to the public in May 2016 \cite{IBM:2016b} and was composed of five
superconducting qubits and was housed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York.

Potted history of platform {https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-12-04-IBM-Debuts-Next-Generation-Quantum-Processor-IBM-Quantum-System-Two,-Extends-Roadmap-to-Advance-Era-of-Quantum-Utility}

The material in this section used the \emph{IBM Quantum Learning} course \emph{Phase Estimation and factoring} \cite{Qiskit:2024a} as a guide.

\subsection{Constructing Circuits \& the Quantum Fourier Transform}

As we have already seen, the \emph{Quantum Fourier Transform} (QFT) is a key building block for Shor's algorithm for matrix inversion.

We obtain the most significant qubit of the fourier transform by applying the Hadamard gate to the least significant qubit of the input.
