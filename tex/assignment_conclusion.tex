\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary of Findings}

Recap the key points discussed in the paper.

\subsection{Personal Insight}

Personally I found reading Shor's papers from the mid-1990's \cite{Shor:1994} \cite{Shor:1997} to be enlightening.  In
short order he was able to layout the salient points from a large and complex branch of science to neatly encapsulate
the mathematical methods and thinking needed to tackle the construction of a class of quantum algorithms.  The
success of his exposition is demonstrated by the brevity of Grover's paper, clocking in at 8 pages \cite{Grover:1996}.

Present your personal viewpoint developed through the research and implementation.
