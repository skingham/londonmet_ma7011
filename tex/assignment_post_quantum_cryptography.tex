\section{Post-Quantum Cryptography}



Quantum systems can only break cryptographic ciphers that, at their core, have mathematical problems that
appear to be NP hard \textbf{check wording here; are all ciphers NP hard} under classical computing, but
that can be solved more quickly \textbf{lower time complexity? poly time?} using quantum circuits or
algorithms, such as Shor, Grove, that we saw in the previous section.

When NIST announced \cite{NIST:2022} the group of four post-quantum cryptographic specifications to
pass the first round of evaluations, the list of technologies had been whittled down by two, removing
\ldots and \ldots.   \ldots would also be dropped in \citeyear{NIST:2022} \cite{NIST:2022}.
